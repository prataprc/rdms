//! Module `spinlock` implement read-write-spinlock, useful for
//! non-blocking concurrency.
//!
//! Blocking concurrency can have impact on latency. When operations
//! that require [rw-exclusion][rw-lock] is going to be quick and short,
//! we can use non-blocking primitives like latch-and-spin.
//!
//! **What is Latch and spin ?**
//!
//! In typical multi-core processors, concurrent read operations are
//! always safe and consistent. But it becomes unsafe, when there is a
//! writer concurrently modifying data while readers are loading it from
//! memory.
//!
//! Latch-and-lock mechanism can be used when we want to allow one or
//! more concurrent writer(s) along with readers.
//!
//! Imagine a door leading into a room. This door has some special
//! properties:
//!
//! 1. The door has a latch and a lock.
//! 2. A **reader** can enter the room only when the door is un-locked
//!    and un-latched.
//! 3. A **writer** can enter the room only when the door is un-locked
//!    and, un-latched and, there are no other **reader** or **writer**
//!    in the room.
//! 4. Once the door is latched by a **writer**, no other **writer**
//!    or **reader** can enter the room because of (2) and (3) properties.
//!    But all **readers** who are already inside the room can finish
//!    their job and then exit.
//! 5. A **writer** can enter the room only after locking the door, which
//!    the **writer** can do only after all the **readers** have exited.
//! 6. When trying to acquire read-permission or write-permission, the
//!    caller thread shall spin until all the conditions from (1) to (5)
//!    are met. Once a thread acquires necessary permission it can
//!    continue to finish its job and then release the permission.
//!
